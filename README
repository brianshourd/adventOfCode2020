# Advent of Code 2020

This is a program that solves the puzzles in Advent of Code. It is setup with Gradle, using `gradle init` for the basic scaffolding of the project, and is built with Kotlin.

## Useful commands

* Build: `./gradlew build`
    * `./gradlew installDist` will create the necessary run file in
      `app/build/install/app/bin`, which can be run normally
* Test: `./gradlew test`
    * `./gradlew test -i` will show more details about failures and stderr/stdout
    * `./gradlew test --tests MyTestClass` will just run the tests in
      `MyTestClass`
* Format: `./gradlew ktlintFormat`
    * `./gradlew ktlintCheck` will not auto-format, and will just check and
      output any problems
* Run: `./gradlew run`
    * Note, this is very limited, as it cannot accept stdin by default, nor read
      command line args. Instead, build with `startScripts`, and then run from bin
